# Pizza-Store-Sales-Analysis-Report


Have you ever wondered how data analysis can help drive sales for small business owner? I took a step to analyze pizza sales dataset identifying key insights that could help pizza store owner improve sales strategies.

Using Power BI, I started by analyzing what are the insights that owner might be interested of : 
* Monthly order trends 
* Identify peak hours to manage manpower 
* Identify bestseller by category and highest sales by flavor.


Here are some interesting insights I have found:

üçï   The highest order of the month is July. The average monthly order is around 1,700-1,800, but there were a few months where sales dipped below average ( around 1,600). By analyzing the data further, we could identify the cause and take actions such as implementing promotion strategies or launching new flavors during those months to boost sales.

üçï   The peak hours in the pizza store are from 12-2pm and 5-7pm. By arranging manpower to cover these peak hours, store managers can ensure that orders are completed in a timely manner.

üçï  The bestseller in the pizza store is the Classic flavor, which accounts for 30% of total orders. It's also the best flavor all year long.

üçï The most popular pizza option in the store is the Big Meat S, but the pizza that contributes to the highest sales is Thai Chicken in L.

üçï We could see an increasing trend in vegan pizza sales from July to September, with some flavors from the veggie category contributing to the top 3 sales among all pizzas.
